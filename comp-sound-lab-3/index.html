        The first part of this project was making the "dial tone" that you hear when you pick up the phone.
        The sound itself is just simple additive synthesis of two oscillators at different frequencies.
        The more interesting part was making the "telephone line" module, which Farnell implemented in PureData using
        the clip~ object to introduce some distortion, and then running the signal through several filters to simulate
        a physical telephone line.<br> <br>
        The hardest part of this was figuring out how to clip the signal the way that PureData does.
        I realized (after some Googling) that the WaveShaperNode does pretty much
        the same thing as a PureData clip~ object if you give it an array of [lowerClip, upperClip], so
        I used WaveShaperNodes as clipping objects. <br>

        The next part, making the sounds for pressing numbers, was very simple - it's just
        additive synthesis of two oscillators at different frequencies, then passed through a
        highpass filter. I added an extra gain node after the filter to match volumes with the
        other sounds.

        <br /><br />
        The next part was the ringing sound that happens after you dial the number.
        This one is kind of interesting in that the buffer and lowpass filter are modulating
        the amplitude of the gain node. The buffer is just three seconds of signal = 1, followed
        by three seconds of signal = 0, so the oscillators alternate between being on and being off
        every three seconds. This seemed to be a better way of switching between having
        sound on/off, as opposed to using a setTimeout() which is annoying for being asynchronous.
        The signal then goes through the exact same "telephone line" module as the dial tone.
        <br /><br />
        I made the buffer followng the example from the babbling brook brown noise, but filled it with half 1's and half 0's instead.

        <br />
        Finally, the last sound is the "line busy" tone. This one also used a similar amplitude modulation
        with the lowpass filter, and it also incorporated the WaveShaperNode/clipping as well. This time, the
        periodic on/off sound is implemented through the clipping, since the [0, 1] curve basically chops
        the sine waves in half horizontally, leaving time intervals where the signal=0.

        One interesting piece of code I came up with outside of the sound synthesis was the sequencing apparatus
        for playing back the numbers that you dialed. I was running into a lot of trouble with setTimeout() inside of for loops,
        so I ended up using this while loop inside a for loop instead. It first populates a list with the times at which
        numbers should be dialed, and then the for loop iterates over each number. The while loop basically operates as a
        wait() function here and doesn't play the next number until it reaches the proper time.
